theinternet he took me on a long walk inCentralPark listened carefully to me andfinally said that sounds like a reallygood idea but it would be an even betteridea for someone who didn't already havea goodjob you can have a job or you can have acareer or you can have a calling and ifyou can somehow figure out how to have acalling you have hit the jackpot cuzthat's the bigdeal I met Jeff basos 25 years ago andhe told me Dave I want you to invest inmy company what are you doing I'm goingto start a bookstore in my garage okayI'm going to put it online people buybuy online and I'm a ship out of mygarage but but if you invest in meDave someday I'm going to be the richestman in the world I'll do over $100billion first of all there is no suchthing as a100 billion 25 years agostatistically

you're very passionate aboutand don't try to chasewhat is kind of the hot Passion of theday seen in that light it really was adifficult choice but ultimately Idecided I had to give it ashot I didn't think I'd regret tryingandfailing and I suspected I would alwaysbe haunted by a decision to not try atall after muchconsideration I took the less safe pathto follow my passion and I'm proud ofthatchoice as a young boy I had been agarage inventor I'd invented anautomatic gate closer out of cementfiled tires a solar cooker that didn'twork very well out of an umbrella andaluminumfoil baking pan alarms to entrap mysiblings I'd always wanted to be aninventor and she wanted me to follow mypassion was a mil military phrase that Iespecially love and it says slow issmooth and smooth is fast and I haveseen that in every Endeavor I've everbeen in that's the kind of thing thatreally allows you to make progress youknow you get certain um gifts in lifeand you want to take advantage of thoseum

sweat that's achoice you can't really be proud of yourgifts because they were given to you umyou can be great f for them and thankfulfor them um and but your choices youchoose to work hard um you
